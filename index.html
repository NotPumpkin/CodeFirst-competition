      <p>While other countries rapidly expand renewables,
        clean energy in the UK is facing an uncertain future.
        Cuts to the industry, dished out under the previous
        government, have already triggered thousands of job
        losses. And now Brexit is putting investment in the
        industry on even shakier ground. </p>

      <p>But right now, Theresa May's government has a
        chance to get things back on track. </p>

      <p>Government ministers are currently drawing up
        plans for UK clean power. So together, let’s
        tell the government that, instead of building risky
        and expensive nuclear plants - like Hinkley -
        and instead of forcing fracking on us, they must
        support clean, renewable power.</p>
